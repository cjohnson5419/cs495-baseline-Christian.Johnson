What programming languages have you used?
I mostly use Java and knowledge about Python and C. 

Did you code mostly in classes, internships, real jobs, or personal projects? Put example projects and what did you do.
Most of my code comes from classes like my currecny converter and a banking system to simulate accessing a bank account. 

What was the largest program/system youâ€™ve worked on?
Currency Converter is my biggest and proudest program I developed so far. 

What do you feel most comfortable doing in code?
When I'm sticking to a plan and flowing through the process. 

What do you feel least comfortable doing?
When I don't have a sense of what is going on with the program or soemthing is causing the 
program to give an error and I have no idea where it is.
